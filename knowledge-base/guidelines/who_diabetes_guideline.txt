TITLE: Global Report on Diabetes – Executive Summary
SOURCE: World Health Organization (WHO)

[OVERVIEW]
Diabetes is a serious, chronic disease that occurs when the pancreas does not produce
enough insulin or when the body cannot effectively use the insulin it produces.

Diabetes is a major public health problem and is one of four priority noncommunicable
diseases targeted for global action. The prevalence of diabetes has increased steadily
over recent decades.

[GLOBAL BURDEN]
Globally, an estimated 422 million adults were living with diabetes in 2014, compared to
108 million in 1980. The global prevalence of diabetes nearly doubled from 4.7% to 8.5%
among adults.

Diabetes prevalence has increased more rapidly in low- and middle-income countries
than in high-income countries.

Diabetes caused approximately 1.5 million deaths in 2012. Elevated blood glucose
levels contributed to an additional 2.2 million deaths by increasing the risk of
cardiovascular and other diseases.

A significant proportion of diabetes-related deaths occur before the age of 70,
particularly in low- and middle-income countries.

[TYPES OF DIABETES]
Most people with diabetes have type 2 diabetes. Type 1 diabetes requires insulin for
survival, while type 2 diabetes occurs when the body cannot properly use insulin.

Separate global prevalence estimates for type 1 and type 2 diabetes are not available.

[COMPLICATIONS]
Diabetes can lead to serious complications affecting multiple organs. These include
heart attack, stroke, kidney failure, vision loss, nerve damage, and lower-limb
amputation.

Poorly controlled diabetes during pregnancy increases the risk of fetal death and
other pregnancy-related complications.

[ECONOMIC IMPACT]
Diabetes and its complications cause substantial economic losses for individuals,
families, health systems, and national economies.

Major cost drivers include hospital and outpatient care, as well as rising costs of
insulin and other diabetes treatments.

[PREVENTION]
Type 1 diabetes cannot currently be prevented.

Type 2 diabetes can be prevented or dela
