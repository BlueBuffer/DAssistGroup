DRUG NAME: Metformin
SOURCE: MedlinePlus (NIH, public)

[USES]
Metformin is used along with diet and exercise to control high blood sugar
in people with type 2 diabetes mellitus. It helps improve the body’s response
to insulin and lowers the amount of sugar produced by the liver and absorbed
by the intestines.

[DOSAGES]
Metformin is taken by mouth, usually one to three times daily with meals.
Treatment is typically started at a low dose and increased gradually to reduce
stomach upset.

Patients should follow their healthcare provider’s instructions carefully,
continue their diet and exercise program, and monitor blood sugar regularly
while taking metformin.

[SIDE EFFECTS]
Metformin may cause serious side effects, including a rare but potentially
life-threatening condition called lactic acidosis. Symptoms of lactic acidosis
may include unusual tiredness, muscle pain, trouble breathing, stomach
discomfort, dizziness, or a slow or irregular heartbeat.

Common side effects of metformin include diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, upset
stomach, gas, and a metallic taste in the mouth. These effects often improve
as the body adjusts to the medication.

[CONTRAINDICATIONS]
Metformin should not be used in patients with kidney disease, severe liver
disease, or metabolic acidosis, including diabetic ketoacidosis.

Metformin should also be avoided in people with conditions that increase
the risk of lactic acidosis, such as severe dehydration, serious infection,
heart failure requiring medication, or excessive alcohol use.

[DRUG PRESCRIPTION]
Metformin can interact with other medications. Some medicines may affect
kidney function or blood sugar control and increase the risk of side effects.

Dosage adjustments or closer blood glucose monitoring may be required
when metformin is used together with other drugs.

[POTENTIAL DRUG INTERACTIONS]
Certain medications may interfere with how metformin works or increase
the risk of side effects.

These include contrast dyes used in imaging tests, diuretics, corticosteroids,
insulin, sulfonylureas, and alcohol.

Some drugs may raise blood sugar levels, while others may increase the risk
of low blood sugar when taken with metformin. Careful blood glucose
monitoring is recommended when metformin is used with other medications.
