DRUG NAME: Linagliptin
SOURCE: MedlinePlus (NIH, public)

[USES]
Linagliptin is used along with diet and exercise to improve blood sugar control
in adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus. It works by increasing the levels of
certain natural substances in the body that help lower blood sugar when it is
high.

Linagliptin is not used to treat type 1 diabetes or diabetic ketoacidosis.

[DOSAGES]
Linagliptin is supplied as a tablet taken by mouth. It is usually taken once
daily, with or without food.

Linagliptin should be taken at approximately the same time each day. Patients
should follow the directions on their prescription label carefully and should
not take more or less than prescribed by their healthcare provider.

[SIDE EFFECTS]
Linagliptin may cause serious side effects, including inflammation of the
pancreas (pancreatitis), serious allergic reactions, and joint pain that can be
severe.

Low blood sugar (hypoglycemia) may occur when linagliptin is used together with
insulin or certain other diabetes medications.

Common side effects reported with linagliptin include a stuffy or runny nose,
sore throat, cough, and diarrhea.

[CONTRAINDICATIONS]
Linagliptin should not be used in patients with known hypersensitivity to
linagliptin or any of its ingredients.

Patients should inform their healthcare provider if they have a history of
pancreatitis, kidney problems, or allergic reactions to other diabetes
medications before starting linagliptin.

[DRUG PRESCRIPTION]
Linagliptin can interact with other medications. Dosage adjustments or closer
monitoring may be required when linagliptin is used together with other diabetes
medicines, especially insulin or sulfonylureas, to reduce the risk of low blood
sugar.

[POTENTIAL DRUG INTERACTIONS]
Linagliptin may increase the risk of hypoglycemia when used with insulin or
insulin secretagogues, such as sulfonylureas.

Other medications may affect how linagliptin works or increase the risk of side
effects. Blood glucose levels should be monitored closely when linagliptin is
used with other medications.
