DRUG NAME: Glipizide
SOURCE: MedlinePlus (NIH, public)

[USES]
Glipizide is used along with diet and exercise to lower blood sugar levels
in adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus.

Glipizide works by stimulating the pancreas to release insulin.
Glipizide is not used to treat type 1 diabetes or diabetic ketoacidosis.

[DOSAGES]
Glipizide is supplied as a tablet taken by mouth. It is usually taken once
daily, about 30 minutes before breakfast. Some patients may need to take
glipizide more than once daily.

Glipizide should be taken exactly as directed by a healthcare provider.
Patients should not take more or less than prescribed.

[SIDE EFFECTS]
Glipizide may cause low blood sugar (hypoglycemia). Symptoms of hypoglycemia
may include dizziness, shakiness, sweating, hunger, headache, and confusion.
Severe hypoglycemia may result in loss of consciousness or seizures.

Other possible side effects of glipizide include nausea, diarrhea,
constipation, stomach pain, dizziness, and headache.

Rarely, allergic reactions or liver problems may occur with glipizide use.

[CONTRAINDICATIONS]
Glipizide should not be used in patients who are allergic to glipizide or
other sulfonylurea medications.

Glipizide should not be used in people with type 1 diabetes or diabetic
ketoacidosis.

Patients should inform their healthcare provider if they have kidney
disease, liver disease, or glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD)
deficiency before starting glipizide.

[DRUG PRESCRIPTION]
Glipizide can interact with other medications. Some medicines may increase
the risk of low blood sugar, while others may reduce the effectiveness of
glipizide.

Dosage adjustments or closer blood glucose monitoring may be required when
glipizide is taken with other medications.

[POTENTIAL DRUG INTERACTIONS]
Glipizide may increase the risk of hypoglycemia when taken together with
insulin or other diabetes medications.

Certain medications such as beta-blockers, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory
drugs (NSAIDs), antifungal medications, and alcohol may also increase the
risk of low blood sugar when used with glipizide.

Some drugs may raise blood sugar levels and reduce the effect of glipizide.
Blood glucose monitoring is recommended when glipizide is used together
with other medications.
