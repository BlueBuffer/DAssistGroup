# GLP-1 Receptor Agonists

GLP-1 receptor agonists are injectable medications used in the management of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus.
They work by enhancing glucose-dependent insulin secretion, suppressing glucagon release, and slowing gastric emptying.

These medications also promote satiety and may contribute to weight loss, which is beneficial for many patients with Type 2 diabetes.

## Clinical Use

- May be used alone or in combination with other antidiabetic agents
- Not recommended for Type 1 diabetes
