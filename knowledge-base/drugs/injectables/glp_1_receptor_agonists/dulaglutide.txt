DRUG NAME: Dulaglutide
SOURCE: MedlinePlus (NIH, public)

[USES]
Dulaglutide is used along with diet and exercise to improve blood sugar control
in adults and children 10 years of age and older with type 2 diabetes mellitus.
It is also used to reduce the risk of major cardiovascular events, such as heart
attack or stroke, in adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus who have known heart
disease or multiple risk factors for heart disease.

[DOSAGES]
Dulaglutide is supplied as a solution in a prefilled, single-dose pen for
subcutaneous injection. It is injected once weekly on the same day each week,
at any time of day, with or without meals.

Injection sites include the abdominal area (stomach), thigh, or upper arm.
Dulaglutide should not be injected into a vein or muscle. Patients should follow
their healthcare provider’s instructions carefully regarding dose and injection
technique.

[SIDE EFFECTS]
Dulaglutide may cause serious side effects, including inflammation of the
pancreas (pancreatitis), low blood sugar (hypoglycemia) when used with insulin
or certain diabetes medications, kidney problems, severe allergic reactions,
and gallbladder disease.

The most commonly reported side effects of dulaglutide include nausea,
diarrhea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and decreased appetite.

[CONTRAINDICATIONS]
Dulaglutide should not be used in patients with a personal or family history
of medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC) or in patients with Multiple Endocrine
Neoplasia syndrome type 2 (MEN 2).

Do not use dulaglutide if you are allergic to dulaglutide or any of its
ingredients.

[DRUG PRESCRIPTION]
Dulaglutide can interact with other medications. Because dulaglutide slows
gastric emptying, it may affect the absorption of oral medicines.

Dosage adjustments of other diabetes medications, including insulin or
sulfonylureas, may be required to reduce the risk of hypoglycemia. Increased
blood glucose monitoring is recommended when dulaglutide is used together
with other medications.

[POTENTIAL DRUG INTERACTIONS]
Dulaglutide may affect how other medications work by delaying gastric
emptying, which can change the rate at which oral drugs are absorbed.

When dulaglutide is used together with insulin or insulin secretagogues,
such as sulfonylureas, the risk of hypoglycemia may increase. Blood glucose
levels should be monitored closely when dulaglutide is used with other
medications.
