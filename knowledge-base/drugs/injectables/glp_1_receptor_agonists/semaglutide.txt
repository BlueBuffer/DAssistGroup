DRUG NAME: Semaglutide (Ozempic®)
SOURCE: MedlinePlus (NIH, public)

[USES]
Semaglutide is used along with diet and exercise to improve blood sugar control
in adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus. It is also used to reduce the risk of
major cardiovascular events, such as heart attack or stroke, in adults with
type 2 diabetes mellitus who have known heart disease.

[DOSAGES]
Semaglutide is supplied as a solution in a prefilled pen for subcutaneous
injection. It is injected once weekly, on the same day each week, at any time
of day, with or without meals.

Injection sites include the abdominal area (stomach), thigh, or upper arm.
Semaglutide should not be injected into a vein or muscle. Patients should
follow their healthcare provider’s instructions carefully regarding dosing
and injection technique.

[SIDE EFFECTS]
Semaglutide may cause serious side effects, including inflammation of the
pancreas (pancreatitis), gallbladder disease, kidney problems, low blood sugar
(hypoglycemia) when used with insulin or certain diabetes medications, and
serious allergic reactions.

The most commonly reported side effects include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea,
abdominal pain, and constipation.

[CONTRAINDICATIONS]
Semaglutide should not be used in patients with a personal or family history
of medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC) or in patients with Multiple Endocrine
Neoplasia syndrome type 2 (MEN 2).

Do not use semaglutide if you are allergic to semaglutide or any of its
ingredients.

[DRUG PRESCRIPTION]
Semaglutide can interact with other medications. Because semaglutide delays
gastric emptying, it may affect the absorption of oral medicines.

Dosage adjustments of other diabetes medications, including insulin or
sulfonylureas, may be required to reduce the risk of hypoglycemia. Increased
blood glucose monitoring is recommended when semaglutide is used together
with other medications.

[POTENTIAL DRUG INTERACTIONS]
Semaglutide may increase the risk of hypoglycemia when used with insulin or
insulin secretagogues, such as sulfonylureas.

Because semaglutide slows gastric emptying, it may change how quickly oral
medications are absorbed. Blood glucose levels should be monitored closely
when semaglutide is used with other medications.
