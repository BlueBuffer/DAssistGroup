DRUG NAME: Insulin Glargine
SOURCE: MedlinePlus (NIH, public)

[USES]
Insulin glargine is a long-acting, man-made insulin used to control high blood sugar
in adults and children with diabetes mellitus. It provides a steady level of insulin
to help maintain blood glucose control throughout the day and night. Insulin glargine
is not used to treat diabetic ketoacidosis.

[DOSAGES]
Insulin glargine is injected subcutaneously (under the skin) once daily at any time
of day, but at the same time every day. It is typically injected into the thigh,
upper arm, or abdominal area.

Injection sites should be rotated to reduce the risk of skin changes such as
lipodystrophy. Insulin glargine should not be mixed with other insulins and should
not be used in an insulin pump or injected into a vein.

[SIDE EFFECTS]
Insulin glargine may cause serious side effects, including low blood sugar
(hypoglycemia), which can be life-threatening. Other serious side effects include
severe allergic reactions, low potassium levels in the blood (hypokalemia), and
heart failure when used with certain diabetes medications.

Commonly reported side effects include low blood sugar, weight gain, allergic
reactions, injection site reactions, and skin thickening or pits at the injection
site (lipodystrophy).

[CONTRAINDICATIONS]
Insulin glargine should not be used during episodes of low blood sugar
(hypoglycemia) or in patients with known hypersensitivity to insulin glargine
or any of its ingredients.

[DRUG PRESCRIPTION]
Insulin glargine can interact with other medications. Dosage adjustments may be
required when insulin glargine is used together with certain drugs. Increased
blood glucose monitoring is recommended when starting, stopping, or changing
other medications that may affect blood sugar control.

[POTENTIAL DRUG INTERACTIONS]
Many medications can affect how insulin glargine works.

Some medicines may increase the risk of low blood sugar (hypoglycemia), including
other antidiabetic agents, ACE inhibitors, salicylates, and monoamine oxidase
inhibitors (MAOIs).

Other medicines may reduce the blood-glucose-lowering effect of insulin glargine,
such as corticosteroids, diuretics, thyroid hormones, and sympathomimetic agents.

Certain drugs may increase or decrease the effect of insulin glargine or mask the
warning signs and symptoms of hypoglycemia, such as beta-blockers. Careful blood
glucose monitoring is recommended when insulin glargine is used with other
medications.
