[USES]
Insulin Aspart Mix 70/30 is a man-made insulin used to control high blood sugar
in adults with diabetes mellitus. It is a premixed combination of intermediate-acting
insulin and rapid-acting insulin that helps manage blood glucose levels throughout
the day. Insulin Aspart Mix 70/30 is not used to treat diabetic ketoacidosis.

[DOSAGES]
Insulin Aspart Mix 70/30 is injected subcutaneously (under the skin) into the
abdominal area (stomach), buttocks, thighs, or upper arms. It is usually injected
twice daily, with each dose intended to cover two meals or a meal and a snack.

Each dose should be administered within 15 minutes before starting a meal.
Injection sites should be rotated to reduce the risk of skin changes such as
lipodystrophy. Insulin Aspart Mix 70/30 should not be mixed with other insulins
and should not be used in insulin pumps.

[SIDE EFFECTS]
Insulin Aspart Mix 70/30 may cause serious side effects, including low blood sugar
(hypoglycemia), which can be life-threatening. Other serious side effects include
severe allergic reactions, low potassium levels in the blood (hypokalemia), and
heart failure when used with certain diabetes medications.

Commonly reported side effects include low blood sugar, weight gain, injection
site reactions, itching, rash, skin thickening or pits at the injection site
(lipodystrophy), and swelling of the hands and feet.

[CONTRAINDICATIONS]
Insulin Aspart Mix 70/30 should not be used during episodes of low blood sugar
(hypoglycemia) or in patients with known hypersensitivity to insulin aspart or
any of its ingredients.

[DRUG PRESCRIPTION]
Insulin Aspart Mix 70/30 can interact with other medications. Dosage adjustments
may be required when this insulin is used together with certain drugs. Increased
blood glucose monitoring is recommended when starting, stopping, or changing
other medications that may affect blood sugar control.

[POTENTIAL DRUG INTERACTIONS]
Many medications can affect how Insulin Aspart Mix 70/30 works.

Some medicines may increase the risk of low blood sugar (hypoglycemia), including
other antidiabetic agents, ACE inhibitors, salicylates, and monoamine oxidase
inhibitors (MAOIs).

Other medicines may reduce the blood-glucose-lowering effect of Insulin Aspart
Mix 70/30, such as corticosteroids, diuretics, thyroid hormones, and
sympathomimetic agents.

Certain drugs may increase or decrease the effect of Insulin Aspart Mix 70/30 or
mask the warning signs and symptoms of hypoglycemia, such as beta-blockers.
Careful blood glucose monitoring is recommended when Insulin Aspart Mix 70/30
is used with other medications.
