They are commonly used in combination insulin regimens and may be administered once or twice daily.

## Clinical Use
- Used in both Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes
- Often combined with rapid-acting insulin
- May be part of premixed insulin formulations

## Examples
- Insulin 70/30 (NPH-based combinations)
